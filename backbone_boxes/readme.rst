Backbone Boxes
**************

This is a simple example that demonstrates the following:

1. Absolutely minimal CSS and HTML to accomplish a particular task.
2. Simple, simple pub/sub using a Backbone custom event.

This is a great interview exercise. The minimal HTML and CSS is based solely on 
bytes. Moreover, this exercise touches upon whether people understand how to use
CSS3 pseudo-classes.

As for the JavaScript, I'd be looking for something similar to what I did and
use a custom event that's triggered based upon the click. This tests a
candidate's proclivity to use OOP and MVC as opposed to sticking to their tried
and true JQuery-direct-reference methods. I suppose you could write a little
less code with JQuery, but that's the purpose of this exercise.
